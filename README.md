Project Idea: A food delivery application that will allow a customer to order food from a selected restaurant and have it delivered to them while seeing the progress of their 
order. It will also allow the restaurants to enter in all the menu and pricing information. It will allow the driver to see time to get to and from the restaurant and route a 
path for them.

Project Platform: The Project will be a java console app that will use SQL as it's database through Microsoft SQL Server 2019

Project Instructions:

You will need a few things to get the Project running on your machine: 
  1.  You will first need a Java IDE, I like Eclipse but any IDE should work https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
  2.  You will need Microsoft SQL Server Express, I would also get the management tool https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads
  3.  You will need the java drivers for SQL Server, make sure you get the correct driver for your version of Java, I also used windows authentication which requires an additional driver that is in the same folder https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/jdbc/download-microsoft-jdbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15
  4.  

Once you have done the above run the sql file to insert the tables.
